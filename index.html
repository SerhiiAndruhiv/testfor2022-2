Domestic cats use many vocalizations for communication, including purring, trilling, hissing, growling/snarling, grunting, and several different forms of meowing.
<br> Their body language, including position of ears and tail, relaxation of the whole body, and kneading of the paws, are all indicators of mood.
<p> The tail and ears are particularly important social signal mechanisms in cats.
</p> A raised tail indicates a friendly greeting, and flattened ears indicates hostility.</a>

Cats are known for spending considerable amounts of time licking their coats to keep them clean.
<br> The cat's tongue has backward-facing spines about 500 ?m long, which are called papillae. These contain keratin which makes them rigid so the papillae act like a hairbrush.</a>

Among domestic cats, males are more likely to fight than females.
<br> Among feral cats, the most common reason for cat fighting is competition between two males to mate with a female. In such cases, most fights are won by the heavier male.
<p> Another common reason for fighting in domestic cats is the difficulty of establishing territories within a small home.
</p> Female cats also fight over territory or to defend their kittens.</a>
